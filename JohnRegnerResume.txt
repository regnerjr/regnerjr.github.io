    * Wrote and modified testing applications and scripts in various language (C, C++, python, bash, SQL)
    * Executed tests and recorded results
    * During this work I interacted with Windows XP, Linux, BSD, SVN, Git, Emacs, and Vim

### MIT Lincoln Lab -- Air Defense Techniques Software Development Intern  --  _Summers 2009 - 2011_

* Built radar user interface in LabView and C#/WinForms
* Built radar detection sub-components to target FPGA using Matlab/Simulink
* Confident working in a self-directed manner
* Implemented k-means clustering algorithm and associated graph to allow radar operator to determine approximate number and spacing of enemy radar systems operating in the same area.

### United States Navy -- Aviation Electronics Technician   --  _2003 - 2007_

<hr>

### Education - Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) --   _2007-2011_
BS in Electrical Engineering  - _GPA 3.31_ - _Dean's List 12/12 Trimesters_
>Studied Digital Signal Processing and Embedded Systems
<br>

* Developed WinForms GUI to track usage, and remotely control home electrical outlets.

    * Usage was displayed in terms of cost which was collected from the We Energies website automatically.  Developed software to transmit usage statistics wirelessly between the outlet and the PC. This two way communication allowed cost to be displayed on the outlet and power usage to be displayed on the computer. Established team usage of SVN for microcontroller and Windows Application source code.

* iPhone Audio Effects System

    * Wrote iPhone audio effects processor using CoreAudio. Samples were taken from the microphone and processed using a user selected algorithm. Effects available were a variable time echo/reverb  and distortion.

* Autonomous robot project (interrupt driven, procedural)

    * Built and programmed microcontroller robot for line tracking, collision detection and light avoidance.  This was achieved through interfacing various external hardware components with the microcontroler .

* Array signal Processing

    * Studied the usage of multiple sources/sinks to perform noise reduction and beam forming.
