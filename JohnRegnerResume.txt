### Education - Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) <div align=right>_2007-2011_</div>
BS in Electrical Engineering  - _GPA 3.31_ - _Dean's List 12/12 Trimesters_
>Studied Digital Signal Processing and Embedded Systems<br>
 (Emphasis Embedded Systems)


* Developed WinForms GUI to track usage, and remotely control power outlets.

Usage was displayed in terms of cost which was collected from the We
Energies website automatically.  Developed software to transmit usage
statistics wireless between the Outlet and the PC so cost could be
displayed on the outlet, and usage could be displayed on the
Computer. Established team usage of SVN to for microcontroller and Windows Application source code.

* iPhone Audio Effects System

Some paragraph here about the iPhone system that I wrote to read
samples from the microphone and preform different user requested
effects on the input signal, echo, distortion

* Autonomous robot project (interrupt driven, procedural)

Built and programmed microcontroller robot for line tracking,
collision detection and light avoidance. Using the C programming
language and the features of the microcontroller.

* Array signal Processing

Studied the usage of multiple sources/sinks to preform noise reduction
and beam forming.
