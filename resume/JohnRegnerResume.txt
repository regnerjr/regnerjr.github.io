### Education - Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE)  --  _2007-2011_
BS in Electrical Engineering  - _GPA 3.31_ - _Dean's List 12/12 Trimesters_
>Studied Digital Signal Processing and Embedded Systems
<br>

* Developed WinForms GUI to track usage, and remotely control home electrical outlets.
    * Outlet displayed real-time cost based on usage and automatically collected price. Wireless communicatio between outlet and pc allowed cost and usage to be displayed on both devices.
    * Established team usage of SVN for microcontroller and Windows Application source code.

* iPhone Audio Effects System
    * Wrote iPhone audio effects processor using CoreAudio. Samples from microphone were taken and processed using a user selected algorithm. Effects available were a variable time echo/reverb and distortion.

* Autonomous Robot (interrupt driven, procedural)
    * Built and programmed microcontroller robot for line tracking, collision detection, and light avoidance.  This was achieved through interfacing various external hardware components with the microcontroler.

* Array Signal Processing
    * Studied the usage of multiple sources/sinks to perform noise reduction and beam forming.
