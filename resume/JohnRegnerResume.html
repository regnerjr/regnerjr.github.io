<h3>Education - Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE)  <span class=right><em>2007-2011</em></span></h3>

<p>BS in Electrical Engineering  - <em>GPA 3.31</em> - <em>Dean's List 12/12 Trimesters</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Studied Digital Signal Processing and Embedded Systems
<br></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Developed WinForms GUI to track usage, and remotely control home electrical outlets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Outlet displayed real-time cost based on usage and automatically collected price. Wireless communication between outlet and pc allowed cost and usage to be displayed on both devices.</li>
<li>Established team usage of SVN for microcontroller and Windows Application source code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>iPhone Audio Effects System</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrote iPhone audio effects processor using CoreAudio. Samples from microphone were taken and processed using a user selected algorithm. Effects available were a variable time echo/reverb and distortion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Autonomous Robot (interrupt driven, procedural)</p>

<ul>
<li>Built and programmed microcontroller robot for line tracking, collision detection, and light avoidance.  This was achieved through interfacing various external hardware components with the microcontroler.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Array Signal Processing</p>

<ul>
<li>Studied the usage of multiple sources/sinks to perform noise reduction and beam forming.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
