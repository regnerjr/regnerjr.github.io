          <br>
          <br>I was introduced to computers as a typical user: video games as a child, Instant Message in High School, GarageBand as a young adult. I never really found the crack from userland into the minecraft like world of the programmer. Where anything can be made from the multitude of bits that are lying around.
          <br>
          <br>I got my first introduction to programming while studying for my BS in Electrical Engineering. I will never forget that. C language programming on a microcontroller. If the LED lights up then you know your programming is working. The first program that we were tasked with running included a `for(;;){ //statements }` loop. From there it just bloomed and kept blooming. I took all the programming classes offered for EE's which is to say more Embedded Systems.
          <br>
          <br>Somehow it still managed to ignite a spark in me. I went on to finish my BSEE but I knew that I would be a programmer. I had a repeat internship developing a radar test platform. Each summer when I returned the project had grown more advanced and the programming language had changed. Summer one was working in LabView, then we advanced to C#/WinForms, and finaly my last summer I was developing for an FPGA using Matlab/Simulink.
          <br>
          <br>All of this is to say that I have experience with a number or computing platforms, lanugages, and paradigms. I would really like to know more.
          <br>
          <br>After leaving college with a degree in EE I decided that I was going to try to cross over into a more software focused role. I found a role doing software testing for an embedded company. It turns out that that looks a lot more like writing word documents than developing bash scripts to test things.
          <br>
          <br>I believe in automation. If it will take the same amount of time to do a task manualy or to automate it, then it should be automated because that second time it saves you the whole time.
          <br>
          <br>I believe that documentation should be written in plain text. If a document needs to be written it should be ‘generated’ by a script in a reproducible manner. We are programmers, shouldn't we program our documentation.
          <br>
          <br>I believe that people should strive to master their tools, and that people should use professional tools.
          <br>
          <br>I have taken the time to learn much about the unix tool set and love any opportunity to work from the command line. I don't thing I could survive without it at this point.
          <br>
          <br>Source should always be under version control (I am quickly leaning to love git), commit messages should be long and detailed. Commits should be small and easily understood.
          <br>
          <br>I want to work with people, who are genuinely excited by technology. People who feel that it is a privelidge to do this work. People who want to make the world a better place through their use of computers.
          <br>
          <br>I am not a front-end web developer but I built myself this website using the foundation framework. I have never used but have heard of jQuery, Angular.js and Ember.js.
          <br>
          <br>I would like to look into Go and Rust one of these days because I think that the future will not be written in C++ or any memory unsafe language (see also heart bleed, or the gnuTLS, or goto fail).
          <br>
          <br>Dont take my shallow pool of experience to mean that I dont know anything. It is a big pool, just not very deep.
          <br>
          <br>Do you have a place for me where I can improve the world through software?
          <br>
