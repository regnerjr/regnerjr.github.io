      <h1>John Regner</h1>

      <p>My introduction to computers started like most; I enjoyed video games as a child,
        instant message as a teen, and music production as a young adult. In college, I
        discovered programming during an innocuously named class: Embedded Systems.</p>

      <p>C programming on a microcontroller is probably the most confusing introduction
        to programming. When the LED lights up you know your code works. If it does not,
        then you must edit, compile, and try again. It was during this experience that I
        started to feel the pull toward a career in programming.
      </p>

      <p>I had the opportunity to work as a summer intern for 3 years at MIT Lincoln Lab.
        I developed the user interface for a radar test platform in two different programming
        languages and developed some components for an FPGA. Each time I returned, the project
        had grown more advanced and the programming language became more sophisticated. The first
        summer involved working in LabView, then we advanced to C#/WinForms, and during my last
        summer I was developing for an FPGA using Matlab/Simulink.</p>

      <p>I have taken the time to learn much about the unix tool set and love working from
        the command line. I don&#8217;t think I could survive without it.</p>

      <p>All of this is to say that I have experience with a number of computing platforms,
        languages, and paradigms. But I am always thirsting to know more. My Instapaper queue
        is full of programming articles and I frequent blogs, podcasts, and follow many
        programmers. Programming isn't just a career, it's also my interest.</p>

      <p>I want to work with people who are genuinely excited by technology, who feel that
        it is a privilege to do this work, and who want to improve the world through their
        use of computers.</p>

        <p>I believe in automation. If there is a possibility of having to do a
          task again you should automate it.</p>

      <p>I believe that documentation should be written in plain text. If a
        document needs to be written it should be ‘generated’ by a script in a
        reproducible manner.</p>

      <p>I believe that people should strive to master their tools.</p>

      <p>I believe source should always be under version control. I am quickly
        leaning to love git. Commit messages should be long and detailed.
        Commits should be small and easily understood.</p>

      <p>I believe modern programming languages are the future (see also
        HeartBleed, or the gnuTLS bug, or Apple's goto fail).</p>
