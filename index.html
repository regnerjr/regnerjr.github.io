      <h3>--== * Tag Line Here * ==--</h3>
<p>I was introduced to computers as a typical user; I enjoyed video games
as a child, instant message in high school, and GarageBand as a young
adult. It was not until college that I discovered programming. My
introduction came during an innocuously named class: Embedded Systems.</p>

<!-- I never really found the crack from userland into the minecraft like -->
<!-- world of the programmer. Where anything can be made from the multitude -->
<!-- of bits that are lying around. -->

<p>Looking back this is probably the most confusing way to learn
programming. C language programming on a microcontroller. If the LED
lights you know your programming is working, if not edit,compile, and
try again. It was during this course, that I started to feel the pull
toward a career in programming.</p>

<p>During the summers while I worked on my degree I had the opportunity
to work at a world class research laboratory. I developed the user
interface to a radar test platform. Each summer when I returned the
project had grown more advanced and the programming language became
more sophisticated. Summer one was working in LabView, then we
advanced to C#/WinForms, and finaly my last summer I was developing
for an FPGA using Matlab/Simulink.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that I have experience with a number of
computing platforms, lanugages, and paradigms. But I am always
thirsting to know more.</p>

<p>After leaving college with a degree in EE I decided that I was going
to try to cross over into a more software focused role. I found a role
doing software testing for an embedded company. It turns out that that
looks a lot more like writing word documents than testing things.</p>

<p>I believe in automation. If it will take the same amount of time to do
a task manualy or to automate it, then it should be automated because
that second time it saves you the whole time.</p>

<p>I believe that documentation should be written in plain text. If a
document needs to be written it should be ‘generated’ by a script in a
reproducible manner. We are programmers, shouldn&#8217;t we program our
documentation.</p>

<p>I believe that people should strive to master their tools, and that
people should use professional tools.</p>

<p>I have taken the time to learn much about the unix tool set and love
any opportunity to work from the command line. I don&#8217;t thing I could
survive without it at this point.</p>

<p>Source should always be under version control (I am quickly leaning to
love git), commit messages should be long and detailed. Commits should
be small and easily understood.</p>

<p>I want to work with people, who are genuinely excited by
technology. People who feel that it is a privelidge to do this
work. People who want to make the world a better place through their
use of computers.</p>

<p>I am not a front-end web developer but I built myself this website
using the foundation framework. I have never used but have heard of
jQuery, Angular.js and Ember.js.</p>

<p>I would like to look into Go and Rust one of these days because I
think that the future will not be written in C++ or any memory unsafe
language (see also heart bleed, or the gnuTLS, or goto fail).</p>

<p>Dont take my shallow pool of experience to mean that I dont know
anything. It is a big pool, just not very deep.</p>

<p>Do you have a place for me where I can improve the world through
software?</p>
